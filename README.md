## Summary
Three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing disparities among the city types are as follows:
    
* Population plays a large role in total Fares, as seen, urban cities have a higer Total Fare based on sheer volume alone when looking at Total fares versus to TotaL Rides.
    
* There is opportunity to increase fares in the urban city rides to match the average fare per ride, currently there is a enough of a disparity beteeen rural fare per ride and urban fares per ride.  

* If there were a few less total drivers in the urban city type, it would also increase the average fare per driver, but this could still impact the volue of rides so there is a critical decision to be made in that respect.
